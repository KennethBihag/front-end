    <span id="1">Radix Sort</span>
    <p>
        Radix sort works by sorting each digit from least significant digit to most significant digit. So in base 10
        (the decimal system), radix sort would sort by the digits in the 1's place, then the 10's place, and so on. To
        do this, radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort the digits in each place value.

    <span id="2">Construct Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence</span>
    <p>
        Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:
        <br><br>
        The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
        Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
        For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.
        The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j
        - i|.
        <br><br>
        Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is
        always a solution.
        <br><br>
        A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a
        and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is
        lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is
        greater than 5.

    <p>
        Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
